- General error handling
    - [ ] Document errors on Swagger UI
    - [ ] Ensure that all endpoints have the following response body on errors:
        - errorCode: não havendo uma instrução em sentido contrário, repassar o response code do Keycloak
        - errorDescription: descrição do erro provida pelo desenvolvedor (grupo)
        - errorSource: origem do erro final (exemplos: OAuthAPI, CoursesAPI, BuildingsAPI etc.)
        - errorStack: pilha de todos os erros até o erro final 
- [X] Autocreate realm if not present
- [X] Token introspection for admin accounts
- [X] Endpoint authorization through Keycloak's OAuth2 endpoint (given a token and a resource, check if the user is authorized to access it)
    - We can probably use the token introspection endpoint to get all authorized resources for a user
    - [ ] Return 200 if the user is authorized to access the resource
    - [ ] Return 403 if the user is not authorized to access the resource
- [X] Recreate and store our client's secret (client is already created in the realm, we just need to autocreate the secret now)
- [ ] OAuth2 Swagger UI authorization? maybe..?
